**Unit 1: Foundations of Public Relations** <span id="1"></span> 
*To understand where the field of public relations is heading, it helps
to know its history.  The past of public relations is still relatively
young, so thankfully we do not need to dig too deep to find its roots.
 Public relations campaigns can involve media relations, employee and
member relations, community affairs, government regulation, financial
reporting, issues management, marketing communications, fund raising,
and most any aspect of an organization’s interaction with people inside
or outside of its doors.  Public relations professionals frequently
advise the higher rungs of management, helping top decision-makers
formulate a company message.  Once that message is developed, it is
disseminated to stakeholders within an organization and to the general
public, using appropriate tools for effective outreach and media
relations.*
