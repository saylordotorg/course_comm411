**Unit 5: Writing for Public Relations** <span id="5"></span> 
*Public relations communications may take many forms from media releases
to public speaking, counseling, training seminars, and hosting public
events.  Public relations writing will embrace a range of styles from
straight-laced, corporate-speak to artsy, entertaining, and
spellbinding.  Sloppy disregard for fundamental rules will alienate the
editors who control the gates of information flow and will undermine
authority with your audience.  One key resource for public relations
writers is the* AP Stylebook, *which covers the standard writing style
expected by most print editors.  Writing primers can help with the basis
of crafting effective communication.  Examples of successful public
relations materials are readily available: media releases, company
reports, promotional materials, executive speeches, feature articles,
and more.*
