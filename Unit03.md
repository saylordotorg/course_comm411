**Unit 3: Key Target Audiences** <span id="3"></span> 
*Certainly the most important aspect of any outreach campaign is to
first know your target audience.  Once you have clearly identified the
target, all other aspects of your communications plan may readily fall
into place.  Some of the demographic identifiers most critical to a
communicator are age, gender, and income level.  Other useful
demographic information includes education level, marital status,
geographical location, culture, and psychographic information such as a
person’s hopes and fears.  As we come to better understand our target
audience, we are much better prepared to develop a public relations
message and strategize how to disseminate this message.  Publics and
stakeholders are those who share some sort of interest in the issues and
outcome of an endeavor; they could be stockholders, employees,
customers, members of the community, government regulators, vendors,
suppliers, distributors, or even competitors.  Being a stakeholder does
necessarily mean having a financial stake or even awareness that one may
be connected to a company or program’s work.  Quite often, an
organization’s stakeholders have conflicting interests – such as a
company’s managers looking to reduce costs, while its workers demand
higher pay and better benefits.  As you consider the materials in this
unit, try to imagine all of the people who may have an interest in a
particular message or position and the different approaches you might
take to communicate with them.*
