**Unit 8: Ethical Issues in Public Relations** <span id="8"></span> 
*The public relations professional is frequently the conscience of a
company, not only by representing the organization’s interests to the
public, but also by conveying the public’s interests back to the
company.  PR people are often put on the spot – if not to determine the
morality of a course, at least to help envision the fallout.
 Fortunately, there are valuable touchstone tools for finding our way.
 We might also remember that public relations is a two way street: not
only do we represent our organization to the public, but we must also
present the opinions of the public back to our organization.  We should
help our colleagues understand how the public perceives our actions.*
