**Unit 7: Crisis Communications** <span id="7"></span> 
*Success is a long haul, but disasters happen in an instant.  A little
advanced preparation can help save the day when a crisis strikes, and a
crisis communication strategy can calm the flames before the home burns
down.  For most organizations, a crisis is a barrage of urgent,
unexpected, unpleasant events that allows no time to think, organize, or
plan appropriate actions.  Unfortunately, most organizations begin to
plan for crises after the crisis hits.  This is a big mistake.  The goal
of a crisis management plan should be containment and positive
counteraction.  The three best approaches to a crisis are to 1) avoid it
in the first place, 2) quickly address and resolve issues before they
escalate, and 3) seek possible ways to turn your crisis into an
opportunity.*
