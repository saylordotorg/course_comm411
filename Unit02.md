 This is especially true in public relations efforts, where a complex

mechanism guided by a detailed blueprint called the Public Relations
Plan.*

**2.1.1 Public Relations Primer** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Steven R. Van Hook’s Media and Public Relations: A
    Primer**
    Link: Steven R. Van Hook’s *[Media and Public Relations: A
    Primer](http://wwmr.us/primer/)* (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and visit this
    interactive resource.  You should briefly review each of the primer
    modules (Modules 1–8), and make a note of any resources or templates
    you may find especially useful.  These resources and templates may
    be useful at a future date as you undertake a public relations
    campaign.  We will refer back to this primer elsewhere in the course
    for specific examples supporting subunit topics ahead, but for now
    it provides a useful overview of the public relations craft and some
    tools at its disposal.  This primer was prepared to help government
    and business leaders in the former Soviet Union make the transition
    from a centralized system to a market environment, where they were
    expected to interact with a freer and more independent media.  The
    concept of “public and media relations” was new to many of these
    leaders, so this primer provides a fundamental overview of the basic
    ideas and tools of PR.  
      
     You should dedicate approximately 2 hours for an initial review and
    exploration of this primer.
