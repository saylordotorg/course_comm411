**Unit 6: Social Projects and Public Relations** <span id="6"></span> 
*Public relations skills, tools, and tactics are not only for achieving
business ends, but also serve to advance social programs and outreach
projects in public education, health, political campaigns, human rights,
and many other ends that promote a public cause rather than a private
interest.  Many of the same tactics and tools apply to social promotions
as to commercial, though quite often more must be undertaken on smaller
budgets in the attempt to change hearts and minds, rather than simple
behaviors.*

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article
    by social marketing author Nedra Kline Weinreich.  Many of the
    communication tactics working for social programs are the same as
    those applied to commercial undertakings, including the most
    fundamentals of traditional marketing and public relations.
     However, social communications focus more on the consumer rather
    than the product.  Notice also how social marketing expands the
    concept of publics, partnerships, policy, and purse-strings for a
    wider range of stakeholders in a project’s activities and results.
