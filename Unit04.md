**Unit 4: Media Relations** <span id="4"></span> 
*One sure need of all organizations that produce newspapers, magazines,
television programs, radio broadcasts, and websites is material to fill
up their pages and their broadcast time.  In Public Relations, you need
only supply media outlets with the material they crave in a way they can
use it.  Media releases are going to be your primary and most important
means of contact with editors and reporters.  The* Wall Street
Journal *estimates that 90 percent of its coverage originates from
companies making their own announcements.  The best way to develop your
skills in media relations is to work as a reporter in different media,
but it also serves to learn to think like a reporter: what does a
reporter look for?  How could you present your message in a way that
appeals to the media?  This is such a critical topic; you will have a
large number of related readings assigned in this unit as well as the
next unit on Writing for Public Relations.*
