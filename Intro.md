Course Syllabus for "COMM411: Public Relations"
-----------------------------------------------

Effective public relations skills are essential to so much of the
success in private and public spheres.  Public relations efforts address
how we wish to present ourselves to others and how to deal with the
perceptions of who others believe we are.  Public relations tactics are
useful for large international corporate projects, or something as
personal as networking for your own career advancement. If you are
taking this course as part of a communications major, you may well find
most every other course in the program is based on addressing how we
relate to others.  The field of public relations takes the theories of
human interaction and applies these theories for real-life results. This
course will help prepare you to conduct public relations suitable for
small start-up businesses, international companies, political campaigns,
social programs, personal development, and other outreach projects.
 There are many tools useful to effective public relations.  As we
review the components of a public relations campaign, you will learn how
to prepare the key materials that will help you get the job done.  You
will examine what has worked for others, as you craft your own form and
style.  You may develop your own public relations portfolio including
news releases, pitch letters, biographies, position papers, crisis
communications, and other tools of a strategic public relations kit.
 You will accomplish this by referring to diverse resources and
examining extensive materials from successful practitioners in the
field.

free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
You will also need to complete the discussion board posts for each unit
as well as the Final Exam.  
  
 Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final
Exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to keep detailed notes on the readings and resources throughout the
course units.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **136.25 hours **to complete, including participation in
the discussion board posts and reflection of the resources.  Each unit
includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of time you are
expected to spend on each subunit.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and determine how much time you have to complete
each unit and to then set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1
should take 12.25 hours to complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your
calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 5.25 hours) on
Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 2 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit
1.3 (a total of 5 hours) on Wednesday and Thursday nights; etc.
